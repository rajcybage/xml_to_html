          		  Introduction
          		  <p>
            		As the provincial capital of the Free State, and South Africa’s judicial capital, tourism in Bloem (as the locals call it) is generally business oriented. But it’s also a university town, so when school’s in session, nightlife is raging. There’s no real reason to go out of your way to visit Bloem, although it has a few interesting sights if you are in the neighbourhood. Commemorating the 26, 000 women and children who died in British concentration camps during the 1899–1902 Anglo-Boer War, the National Women’s Memorial depicts a bearded Afrikaner, setting off on his pony to fight the British, bidding a last farewell to his wife and baby, who are to perish in one of the camps. It’s a powerful image and one still buried in the psyche of many Afrikaners.
