          		  Introduction
          		  <p>
            		Spanning out from some of the range’s loftiest summits, the 8000-hectare Royal Natal Park (438 6310; www.kznwildlife.com; adult/child US$3.40/2; 5am-7pm) has a presence that far outstrips its relatively meagre size, with many of the surrounding peaks rising as high into the air as the park stretches across. With some of the Drakensberg’s most dramatic and accessible scenery, the park is crowned by the sublime Amphitheatre, an 8km wall of cliff and canyon equally spectacular from below or from up on high. Looming up behind is Mont-aux-Sources (3282m), so called because the Tugela, Elands and Western Khubedu Rivers rise here; the last eventually becomes the Orange River and flows all the way to the Atlantic.The park’s visitors centre (8am-12.30pm &amp; 2-4.30pm) is about 1km in from the main gate. There’s also a shop selling basic provisions. Fuel is available in the park. Except for the Amphitheatre-to-Cathedral (62km, four to five days) and the Mont-aux-Sources (20km, 10 hours) hikes, most of the 25-odd walks in Royal Natal are day walks. The park has become a mecca for climbers. You must apply for a permit from the KZN Wildlife office. If you plan to camp on the mountain, you should book with the QwaQwa tourist officer (058-713 4415). Otherwise there’s a basic hut on the escarpment near Tugela Falls. An overnight hiking permit costs US$4.Thendele (033-845 1000; chalet per person US$43-47), the park’s main camp has a variety of accommodation, including some reasonable two-bed chalets. There are also several places outside the park, including Amphitheatre Backpackers (438 6106; amphibackpackers@worldonline.co.za; camp site US$5.50, dm/d US$10/22), 21km north of Bergville.
